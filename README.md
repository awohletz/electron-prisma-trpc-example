# Purpose
This repo demonstrates:
- Using tRPC over IPC to communicate between the main and renderer processes.
- Using Prisma with an SQLite database.
- End-to-end process of building, signing, notarizing, and publishing an Electron app with electron-builder on Mac and Windows.

electron-prisma-trpc-example intends to provide a clean proof-of-concept that you can pick-and-choose from and integrate into your own Electron app.

This is the next generation of https://github.com/awohletz/electron-prisma-template, simplified, trimmed down, and updated for the latest Electron and other dependencies.

## What about React?
**See the `react` branch**.

The `main` branch of this repo uses the vanilla tRPC client and no frontend framework. This is to keep it minimal for those wanting to pull the techniques into their own Electron setups. However, I've also created a React version on the branch `react`. 

It uses React and Vite for hot-module reloading. I included a stubbed application menu and communication pipe from Main to Renderer.

## Getting started
1. Clone this repo. Then in the project root directory, do the following:
2. Run `npm install`.
4. Edit electron-builder.yml to fill in productName, appId, copyright, and publisherName.
5. Set up code signing. Follow the instructions in https://www.electron.build/code-signing to set up code signing certificates for your platform. Also see my articles: 
    1. Windows: https://dev.to/awohletz/how-i-code-signed-an-electron-app-on-windows-30k5 
    1. Mac: https://dev.to/awohletz/how-i-sign-and-notarize-my-electron-app-on-macos-59bb
5. Edit package.json to fill in your project details. Set the `repository` property to a Github repo where you will publish releases. When you run `npm run dist`, the app will be packaged and published to the Github repo.
   1. Create a Github repo for your app releases. See https://www.electron.build/configuration/publish#githuboptions
   2. Create an access token for your Github repo. See https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
6. Create a `.env` file that looks like this:
```
DATABASE_URL=file:./app.db
# If you are signing and notarizing the app on Mac
APPLE_ID=your apple id
APPLE_ID_PASSWORD=your apple password
APPLE_TEAM_ID=your apple team ID
# If you want to publish releases to Github
GITHUB_TOKEN=your github access token
# If you want to code sign on Windows
CSC_LINK=yourWindowsCodeSigningCert.pfx
CSC_KEY_PASSWORD=your password for the Windows code signing cert
```
5. Now you can run `npm start` to start in dev mode and check out the example app. If you want to test building and publishing a release, see the below sections.

## Scripts
### `npm run build` 
Builds the project code and places it in `dist`. There are two steps to building: 
  1. Use Vite to transpile the frontend TypeScript code in `src/client` and move it to `dist`. 
  2. Generate the Prisma client in `src/generated`
  2. Use the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) to 1. check types in `src/client` (Vite does not check types) and 2. build the backend TypeScript code in `src/server` and place the output in `dist/server`.
  3. Run copy-files.js -- Copy the generated Prisma client from `src/generated` to `dist/generated`
  4. Run install-engines-on-mac.js -- Make sure that node_modules/@prisma/engines has both darwin and darwin-arm64 binaries. These will get packed into the app if you run `npm run pack`.

### `npm start` 
Build and start the app without packaging.

### `npm run pack`
Build, pack, sign, and notarize the app for the current platform. The packed app will be output to `packed` directory. This is a fast way to test packing, signing, and notarizing. It does not publish the app to Github.

Once packed, you can test the outputted app in the `packed` directory. E.g. on Mac M1, open `packed/mac-arm64` in Finder and double-click on ElectronPrismaTrpcExample to run the app.

### `npm run dist`
Build, pack, sign, and notarize the app for production. The only difference between `npm run dist` and `npm run publish` is that `npm run dist` does not publish the app to Github.

### `npm run publish`
Build, pack, sign, notarize, and publish the app. Run this to publish a release to Github. The app will be published to the Github repo specified in `package.json`.


## tRPC usage
The tRPC integration allows Renderer to communicate to Main and get responses back. From tRPC's perspective, the Renderer is a client and the Main process is a server. It does not know that it is communicating over IPC.

In `src/client/renderer.ts` I've provided a custom `fetch` implementation to tRPC client to send the requests over IPC. 

In `src/server/main.ts`, `ipcMain` listens for those IPC requests and fowards them to the tRPC server. To enable this, I built a `ipcRequestHandler` function, which is a customized version of [tRPC's fetchRequestHandler](https://trpc.io/docs/v10/fetch). Instead of sending fetch API Request and Response objects, which cannot be serialized over IPC, it sends plain JSON objects and converts them to Response objects in the Renderer code.

## Prisma usage
electron-prisma-trpc-example uses Prisma to manage the SQLite database. To enable this, I had to leave the Prisma binaries out of app.asar. They do not work when packed inside app.asar. To leave them out, I specified them as excluded files in electron-builder.yml and as extraResources. Then I pass the query engine and migration engine paths from extraResources into the Prisma client constructor and the Prisma migrate command.  

To create a universal build on Mac M1 and Mac Intel, the build and install scripts pack both sets of Prisma binaries. 

## Signing, notarizing, and publishing
The `electron-builder.yml` file has configuration to sign and notarize the app for Mac, Windows, and Linux. You'll have to customize this file to enter your own publisher and app info.

See https://github.com/awohletz/electron-prisma-trpc-example-releases for an example repo that holds the releases for this app. I publish releases to that repo using the `npm run publish` script.

Here are the steps to publish a release on Windows and Mac:
1. Make sure you've set up code signing and have the appropriate env vars in `.env`, as mentioned above in Getting Started. 
2. On your Windows computer, run `npm run publish`
2. On your Mac computer, run `npm run publish`

These commands will build for their respective platforms and upload the release files to your Github repo.

## Debugging
The key parts of the Prisma integration:
- The Prisma binaries/libraries do not work if packed inside of app.asar. Thus they have to be outside of the asar in extraResources. `npm run pack` should move them to ElectronPrismaTrpcExample/Contents/Resources/node_modules/@prisma/engines.
- The Prisma client has to be configured to look for the query engine at that extraResources location (ElectronPrismaTrpcExample/Contents/Resources/node_modules/@prisma/engines). This is done either by [environment variable](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-engines#using-custom-engine-libraries-or-binaries) or by [passing in the path with an internal config prop on the Prisma client constructor](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions/5200#discussioncomment-295575). electron-prisma-trpc-example uses both of these techniques: Env var for the Prisma migrate command (which runs in a separate process) and engine prop for the Prisma client used to do queries in the app. 

If you encounter a problem with Prisma related to it not finding the binaries, you can debug where it locates the binaries like so on a Mac:
1. Open a terminal
2. Run `export DEBUG=prisma*` (see [docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/debugging#setting-the-debug-environment-variable))
3. `cd` to the directory where the app package is. E.g. your Applications directory.
4. Run the app directly inside the .app package by entering on your terminal: `./ElectronPrismaTrpcExample.app/Contents/MacOS/ElectronPrismaTrpcExample`
5. Now you should see a bunch of debug output written to your terminal as the app starts. Prisma will show where it is searching for the binaries.
