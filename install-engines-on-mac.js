// both darwin (for Intel Mac) and darwin-arm64 (for M1 Mac). Those binaries will be included in the extraResources.

// See `qePath` in `src/server/constants.ts`, which gets set with the current platform
// and passed into the Prisma Client constructor.

// Specifying both darwin and darwin-arm64 is also necessary in the schema.prisma file, so that the generated
